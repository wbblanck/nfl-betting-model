# Get a key

> Generate a keypair, register its public half, and see what each key can do.

export const RESTRICTED_STATES = "Arizona, Michigan, and Nevada";

export const COMPANION_WINDOW_DAYS = 3;

export const REVOCATION_SECONDS = 60;

export const MAX_TRADING_READ_KEYS = 128;

export const MAX_MANAGEMENT_READ_KEYS = 128;

export const MAX_MANAGEMENT_KEYS = 1;

You use two kinds of key.

Your first key is the management key. You create it on Profile in the web app.
It runs your account but never places an order.
It also creates every trading key, one per subaccount.

We receive only the public half of each keypair.

| Key | Scope | Reaches | Orders | Money | Live at once |
| - | - | - | - | - | - |
| Management | `management` | The whole account | No | Yes | 1 per trader |
| Trading | `trading` | One subaccount | Yes | No | 1 per subaccount |

* The management key opens, funds, and labels subaccounts. It also creates and revokes keys.
* The management key [reads every wallet](/api/concepts/account-model#read-every-wallet-with-a-management-key): orders, fills, and positions.
* A trading key places and cancels orders. It also streams the order book and your fills.
* You create the management key on [Profile → Settings → Novig API](#create-your-management-key).
* You create a trading key with `POST /v3/account/subaccounts`, signed by the management key.

In these docs, the management key file is `novig-api-key-mgmt-1.pem` and a trading key file is `desk-1.pem`.

These routes manage keys:

| Route | Keys | Rate limit | Success |
| - | - | - | - |
| `POST /v3/keys` | `management` | `account` | <span className="st st-ok">201</span> |
| `GET /v3/keys` | `management` `management::read` | `account` | <span className="st st-ok">200</span> |
| `GET /v3/keys/{id}` | `management` `management::read` | `account` | <span className="st st-ok">200</span> |
| `DELETE /v3/keys/{id}` | `management` | `account` | <span className="st st-ok">204</span> |

## Create your management key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Novig API screen">Open Profile on <a href={PAPER_PROFILE}>paper.novig.com</a> or on <a href={WEB_PROFILE}>novig.com</a>, then press **Settings** and **Novig API**. The screen lists your keys and shows your [location check](#location-checks) result.</Step>
  <Step title="Name the key">Press **Create Key** and enter a nickname, which is only a label and grants no access. The browser generates the keypair with Ed25519, or with P-256 if it can't generate Ed25519.</Step>
  <Step title="Confirm">Press **Confirm Key Creation**. The browser downloads `novig-api-key-<nickname>.pem`, a PKCS#8 PEM file, and shows the private key once.</Step>
  <Step title="Save the private key">If the browser blocked the download, copy the key from the screen. Then press **I've saved my key**, and we never show the private key again.</Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Store the private key in a secret manager before you press **I've saved my key**. We never hold the private key, so we can't show it again.
</Warning>

The key ID shown beside the private key identifies your management key.
Send it in the <code>{KEY_ID_HEADER}</code> header.

If you lose the private key, revoke the key on the same screen and create a new one.
Your web session is the only recovery path.
Until you revoke the key, anyone who holds the private key can act as that key.

## Create other keys with the API

A route creates every key below `management`.
Generate the keypair before you call the route:

```bash theme={"dark"}
openssl genpkey -algorithm ed25519 -out <nickname>.pem
chmod 600 <nickname>.pem
openssl pkey -in <nickname>.pem -pubout -out <nickname>.pub.pem
```

Then send the public key in the request body:

| Field | Type | Required |
| - | - | - |
| `name` | `string` | Yes |
| `publicKey` | `string` | Yes |
| `algorithm` | `Ed25519` or `P-256` | Yes |
| `expiresAt` | `date-time` | No |

* `name` is a label that appears in the key list.
* `publicKey` is the public key as an SPKI PEM, newlines included.
* `algorithm` must match the key material.
* `expiresAt` must be strictly in the future. Never set it on a `management` key, as [Revoke a key](#revoke-a-key) explains.

`POST /v3/keys` and `POST /v3/account/subaccounts` take no `scope` field.
If the body includes one, the route returns <span className="st st-warn">400</span>.
`POST /v3/account/subaccounts/{keyId}/keys` requires one: `trading` or `trading::read`.

The route returns the new key:

| Field | What it is |
| - | - |
| `keyId` | The value for the <code>{KEY_ID_HEADER}</code> header. Not a secret |
| `algorithm` | The algorithm you picked |
| `fingerprint` | The SHA-256 of the public key's SPKI DER |

Pick Ed25519 unless a hardware requirement forces P-256.
Your signer must use the same algorithm.

To compute the fingerprint yourself, run:

```bash theme={"dark"}
openssl pkey -pubin -in <nickname>.pub.pem -outform DER | openssl dgst -sha256
```

## How a key gets its scope

Each key has a scope, which sets what it can reach and do.
Where you create a key decides its scope, so you never name one yourself.

Profile creates the `management` key and generates its keypair in the browser.
A route creates every other key from a public key that you generate.

  <p className="tree-foot">Each line points from a credential to the key it creates.</p>
</div>

| Scope | Bound to | Access |
| - | - | - |
| `management` | Trader | Write |
| `management::read` | Trader | Read |
| `trading` | Subaccount wallet | Write |
| `trading::read` | Subaccount wallet | Read |

| Scope | Create it with |
| - | - |
| `management` | [Profile](#create-your-management-key), from your web session |
| `management::read` | `POST /v3/keys` |
| `trading` | `POST /v3/account/subaccounts` |
| `trading`, replacement | `POST /v3/account/subaccounts/{keyId}/keys` |
| `trading::read` | `POST /v3/account/subaccounts/{keyId}/keys` |

The route that opens a subaccount also creates its `trading` key.
A subaccount has one live `trading` key.
After you revoke it, `POST /v3/account/subaccounts/{keyId}/keys` creates its replacement.
The same route creates `trading::read` keys beside it, up to {MAX_TRADING_READ_KEYS} live per trader across every subaccount.

### Why keys work this way

* Your web session is the root. Its bearer `JWT` is the only credential you hold before your first key, and the only way to a `management` key.
* Every key has its own keypair.
* No key creates a key above itself. Every route that creates a key accepts only a `management` key or your web session, so a leaked read or trading key can't escalate.
* A subaccount and its `trading` key are created together, so no wallet exists without a key. After you revoke that key, `POST /v3/account/subaccounts/{keyId}/keys` creates its replacement.

## Limits

| Limit | Value | Over the limit |
| - | - | - |
| Live `management` keys per trader | {MAX_MANAGEMENT_KEYS} | <span className="st st-warn">409</span> |
| Live `management::read` keys per trader | {MAX_MANAGEMENT_READ_KEYS} | <span className="st st-warn">400</span> |
| Live subaccounts per trader | {MAX_SUBACCOUNTS} | <span className="st st-warn">400</span> |
| Live `trading` keys per subaccount | 1 | <span className="st st-warn">409</span> |
| Live `trading::read` keys per trader | {MAX_TRADING_READ_KEYS} | <span className="st st-warn">400</span> |
| Uses of one public key across Novig | 1 | <span className="st st-warn">409</span> |
| Signed body size | Capped | <span className="st st-warn">403</span> from the edge |

## Location checks

Every signed route runs two location checks.
If either check fails, the route returns `451`. A cancel skips both.

* **IP check:** refuses a request from a restricted state, or through a VPN, proxy, or Tor exit. A data-center address is fine.
* **Companion check:** refuses a key holder whose last device geolocation is missing, failed, named no region, or came from a restricted state. A placement also refuses one older than {COMPANION_WINDOW_DAYS} days. A read admits it.

The restricted states are {RESTRICTED_STATES}.

The newest check on any of the key holder's devices decides.
A failed check blocks the key until a check passes again.
If the check failed only because it couldn't confirm the location, the last pass from the past {COMPANION_WINDOW_DAYS} days still counts.

Some failures name their cause: `GEOLOCATION_OUT_OF_BOUNDARY`, `GEOLOCATION_BLOCKED_NETWORK`, or `GEOLOCATION_BLOCKED_SOFTWARE`.
[451](/api/errors#451-geolocation-unavailable) gives the fix for each.

To pass the companion window check, open the Novig app so your device geolocates.

The Novig API screen shows your check result before you create your first key.
If a window is open, the screen also shows when it expires.

## Revoke a key

To revoke a key, press **×** beside it on Profile → Settings → Novig API.
You can also call `DELETE /v3/keys/{id}`.

Revocation takes effect within {REVOCATION_SECONDS}s, and you can't undo it.

<Warning>
  Revoking a key leaves its resting orders on the book. Cancel them before you revoke the key.
</Warning>

If the key is compromised, change the order.
Revoke it first, then create a replacement, then cancel the resting orders.

<Warning>
  An expired `management` key still takes the only `management` slot, and it can't sign its own revocation. Never set `expiresAt` on a `management` key.
</Warning>

## Rotate a key

* **`management`:** revoke the old key, then create a new one. There's a gap with no key.
* **`management::read`:** create the new key, switch over, then revoke the old one. There's no gap.
* **`trading`:** revoke, then create the replacement with `POST /v3/account/subaccounts/{keyId}/keys`. There's a gap, so cancel orders first.
