# Eligibility

> Which legs can combine in a parlay RFQ.

Any market on the exchange can be a parlay leg.
That covers main lines, player props, and futures, in every league, before the game or live.
There's no list of allowed leagues or market types.

A parlay gets an RFQ unless it breaks one of the rules below.
We refuse a parlay that breaks a rule, and no RFQ goes out.

## Rules for every parlay

* A parlay has 2 to 20 legs. Trade a single leg on the order book.
* Every leg's event is open, either before the game or in play.
* No leg is a special or promo market.
* No leg takes the NO side of a yes-or-no market like a future, a first scorer, a draw, or a three-way moneyline.

## Legs from the same game

Legs from the same game combine, except these pairs:

* Two legs on the same kind of line, like spread and moneyline, two spreads, or two totals.
* The same pairs on first-half lines.
* Two first-scorer legs of the same type, like two first touchdown scorers.
* Power play points with points, assists, goals, or shots on goal, even on different players.

## Legs on the same player

Two legs on the same player are blocked in these cases:

* Both legs use the same market type.
* One stat contains the other, like points + rebounds + assists and points.

## Legs from different games

* Two legs from different games can't share a team.
* A future combines only with legs from other leagues.

<Note>
  The blocked pairs change over time, so treat these as examples. Your pricer sees every leg in the RFQ and can decline any RFQ.
